map is slower than array for iteration
perf difference are bigger with very hight numbers of components : 
it seems array iteration benefit from optimization with hight number of loop, or it just highlight the spread of perf
for game usage, system iteration are done once per frame so it should not benefit from it
real use case for game would rarelly have to update more than 100 components per systems (exepts particles / voxel )
map should be faster for fetching component by id
need to write a benchmark with a system that combine multiple components

fetch component in an object by its id is much faster then in a map or using find() on an array regardless of the number of elements, also difference of perf between Object and hashMap deminish with very large data set (10000+)

iteration is much faster on an array then on Object,
hashMap are faster to iterate than an object on large data set (100+) but slower on smaller data set

idea : create a customHashMap 
with 2 collections kept in parallel
one Object which keep index of elements in the second collection, used for fetching by id
one array used for iteration on value, which keep the actuals elements
insertion of element in the middle should be faster too
should the Object holding index be kepts in the same order as the array holding elements ?
