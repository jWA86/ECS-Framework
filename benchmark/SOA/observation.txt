// map is slower than array for iteration
// perf difference are bigger with very hight numbers of components : 
// it seems array iteration benefit from optimization with hight number of loop, or it just highlight the spread of perf
// for game usage, system iteration are done once per frame so it should not benefit from it
// real use case for game would rarelly have to update more than 100 components per systems (exepts particles / voxel )
// map should be faster for fetching component by id
// need to write a benchmark with a system that combine multiple components
